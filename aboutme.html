            Having been born and raised in Portland, Oregon I carry the west coast vibe with me everywhere. 
            Since I was young I've played soccer, rock climbed, and ran track; which taught me teamwork, leadership, and determination. 
            Deciding I was ready for a change of pace I moved to New York to study design and my relentless energy allowed me to thrive in the fast paced environment.

            What intrigues me about product design is how the user interacts with an object and vice versa: every object tells a story that influences the user at a conscious and subconscious level. 
            What we surround ourselves with in turn affects and reflects who we are as individuals. Design does not happen in a vacuum - it is important to be aware of what is going on in the world. 
            I am influenced by pop culture and trends, and keep up to date on everything from the news to technology to fashion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Curation, intention, and attention act as the principles that influence my life.
            With these I use design as a tool to solve problems through empathy, simplicity, intuition, and collaboration. As timeless as good design should be, it will also inevitably reflect its era; 
            this is why I use digital tools to my advantage, allowing me to blend the lines between the physical and digital realms. Being lost and failing often result in the best ideas; I use these opportunities to learn, adapt, and land on my feet, sprinting forward with my next concept.
