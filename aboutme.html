            Having been born and raised in Portland, Oregon I carry the west coast vibe with me everywhere I go. Since I was a kid I have played soccer, rock climbed, and ran track; teaching me teamwork, leadership, and determination. Upon deciding I was ready for a change of pace I moved to New York to study design. My non-stop energy and background in sports allowed me to thrive in the fast paced environment of New York. What intrigues me about product design is how the user interacts with an object and vice versa; every object tells a story that influences the user at a conscious and subconscious level. What we surround ourselves with in turn effects who we are as individuals. Curation, intention, and attention act as my own principles to influence my life.
            I use design as a tool to solve problems, improve everyday interactions with empathy, simplicity, intuition, and collaboration. Design does not happen in a vacuum, it is important to be aware of what is going on in the world.
